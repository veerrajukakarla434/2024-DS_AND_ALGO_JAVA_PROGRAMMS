/**
 * Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, 
 * the task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling 
 * the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed.
 * Note: Stock must be bought before being sold.
 * 
 * Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4}
	Output: 5
	Explanation:
	The lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day, 
	the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6. 
	Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5. 
	
	Input: prices[] = {7, 6, 4, 3, 1} 
	Output: 0
	Explanation: Since the array is in decreasing order, no possible way exists to solve the problem.
