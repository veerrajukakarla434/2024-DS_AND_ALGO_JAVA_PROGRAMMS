/**
 * Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the MVP's in the array. 
 * An element of array is considered MVP if it is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right side. 
 * The rightmost element is always a MVP. 
 * Example 1: Input: n = 6 A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2} Output: 17 5 2 Explanation: 
 * The first MVP is 17 as it is greater than all the elements to its right. 
 * Similarly, the next leader is 5. The right most element is always a leader so it is also included. 
 * Example 2: Input: n = 5 A[] = {1,2,3,4,0} Output: 4 0 
 * Explanation: 0 is the rightmost element and 4 is the only element which is greater than all the elements to its right. 
 * To Do: You don't need to read input or print anything. 
 * The task is to complete the function find MVP() which takes array A and n as input parameters and returns an array of leaders in order of their appearance. 
 * Constraints: 1 â€‹
