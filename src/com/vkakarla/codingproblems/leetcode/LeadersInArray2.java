/**
 * Given an array A of positive integers. Your task is to find the MVP's in the
 * array. An element of array is considered MVP if it is greater than or equal
 * to all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a MVP.
 * Example 1: Input: n = 6 A[] = {16,17,4,3,5,2} Output: 17 5 2 Explanation: The
 * first MVP is 17 as it is greater than all the elements to its right.
 * Similarly, the next leader is 5. The right most element is always a leader so
 * it is also included. Example 2: Input: n = 5 A[] = {1,2,3,4,0} Output: 4 0
 * Explanation: 0 is the rightmost element and 4 is the only element which is
 * greater than all the elements to its right. To Do: You don't need to read
 * input or print anything. The task is to complete the function find MVP()
 * which takes array A and n as input parameters and returns an array of leaders
 * in order of their appearance. Constraints: 1 â€‹
